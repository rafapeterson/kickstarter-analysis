# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
##Background##
In order to determine if the goal of a successful kickstarter would be attainable, a historical sampling of kickstarter projects were analyzed. In review, focus was placed on country, category of kickstarter (specifically looking at theater/plays), whether the kickstarter succeeded, failed, was cancelled, or was still live. Findings were initially focused on producing a play in the USA, however analysis was also completed around producing a play in Great Britain with a £4000 goal.
##Historical Successes##
Historically the Theater category of crowdfunding in the US has done very well, with 525 campaigns being successful out of 912. ![PCO](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13009587/132905475-091b1e96-efb4-4cf8-b51b-25ab1848bf82.png)
Within the Theater category, Plays have a similarly high performance, with only 70 out of 313 campaigns being labelled "failed."![Subcategory Stats](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13009587/132905676-0cff617a-9d12-4d7a-8f31-cbbbf9b3654b.png)
Also, the summer months of May-July seem to be the best performing months, with a spike between May and June.

##Considerations##
A consideration that should be made is the goal being requested. The mean successful goal was $5049, with the mean failed goal of $10,554. Goals that are higher are statistically more likely to fail. Review of the goal amount should take place, while using the data provided in the Excel sheet on the "Descriptive Statistics" being especially considered.

##Great Britain Results##
In respect the potential £4000 goal, £4000 would be an outlier of the normal pledge amount. This should be taken into consideration, as the mean pledge amount is $1046.96.  ![GB Analysis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13009587/132906710-a3c8b89b-0e4c-44a8-b83b-3c111904f713.png)

##Recommendations##
I recommend proceeding as planned with the US Kickstarter, but aiming for a launch date of late spring/early summer. I would also consider a goal amount of approximately $5000.00. In regards to producing a play in Great Britain, I would strongly suggest reevaluating the goal amount and reducing it to around $2000, with an expectation of a lower pledge amount.
